## Hello, I'm Anastasia
I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast building a home lab and documenting the process here, including design, configurations, and lessons learned. Here you’ll find my projects ranging from network setups to red and blue team engagements, incident simulations, and other security-related explorations.
